          <h1>The City</h1>
          <p>Chania is the capital of the Chania region on the island of Crete. The city can be divided in two parts, the old town and the modern city.</p>
          <p>One of the most famous inventions in 20th century is television and nowadays we cannot deny its influence to our life. There is a common question that has television destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally believe that television has not destroyed communication among friends and family. In this essay I try to explain my opinion with some reasons.

            First of all, television is the most common media which is found in each home. It is faster than newspaper to tell the news, more economical than Internet to access information. Television not only is an enjoyable device for everyone but also joins family members together and brings them good time, for example they can talk about their favorite actor or actress, watching football and betting on their favorite player.
            
            Another reason is that these days people are very busy with their works and have not enough time to go cinema and theater instead television provides for them this chance to have a similar one. Moreover, nowadays towns have become more and more crowded and people do not know each other, while television builds a smallest town with its famous faces and interesting programs.

            <p>For decades, television had played a very important role in our life. It had changed our living and entertaining way in a great way, and I believe that it had also influenced our behavior, both for the better and for the worse. Firstly, movies and television make us more violent. We are being accustomed the violent scenes on the movies where there are brutal and icy faces with killing machines in their hands. We are also forgetting that killing someone is permanent, because the actors that were killed in a film can come back for another movie. And finally, have you ever imagined that you were Arnold Schwarzenegger in the “Terminator” when you watch that film? Secondly, movies and television are making us less active. We think that movies and television contain everything so we do not have to go out to chat or play games with our friends. Staying in and watching television for a long time can seriously damage us, both mentally and physically. Watching movies is passive. We receive everything that the director gives to us. Some of them may be good, some may be bad but the most important thing is we will lose our imaginary ability. And we may act like the actors on the movie. On the contrary, we cannot oppose that television has good influence to us. There are good movies that can make us change our prejudices of something like “racial dividing”. Even education programs can help us behave more graciously and wisely. Moreover, by watching movies, we can temporarily escape from our problems and that will help you reduce your stress. Anyway, television and movies have their strong influence to our behavior. Whether the influence is good or bad depends on how long we watch them, what we watch and how we respond to them because everything is advantageous in a way and disadvantageous in another.

            <p>If I could change one thing about my hometown, I would like to build some useful and advanced facilities for its use. A modern library, an advanced broad band system and a modern gym may bring a lot of changes to people living in my hometown and keep them up with the latest information and technology.

                In my opinion, a modern library in my hometown can provide a good environment for the local people to study and upgrade themselves. There are a lot of newspapers, magazines and reference books for their use. They can know what happened around the world and keep up with the fast- pace of today’s world. "Knowledge is strength". Knowledge can guide us to overcome problems we face in our daily life.
                
                To popularize the use of broadband cable system at homes enables people to get a quick access to the Internet and TV channels. Because of the Internet, our lives have been changed a lot. We can read news, shopping, chat with our friends, send pictures to anyone and watch the movies online. People can also have a lot of choices over TV programs offered through a broadband. A pay-per-view system provides different types of movie for you to choose from. People will have more choices to enjoy life and the advanced technology at home.
