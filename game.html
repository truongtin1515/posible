     <p>University is the place where students get knowledge and new experiences. Studying in university gives a vast exposure to the student in his specified field. University builds a professional base in the student.

        Till their higher school students used to study in various fields. They have to read different subjects which are not in their career streams. Therefore they attend college or universities to get ample knowledge of their field. Universities and colleges have experienced staff in diverse fields. Everyone is professional in their stream therefore students gets the opportunity to learn from these persons(professors) various skills in their stream which is not possible while studying in higher school.
        
        Secondly various projects, researches, assignments and practical scenarios are conducted in universities or colleges from where students get exposure and experience to various problems which they might have to face in their real life while practicing. Like in dentistry the students have to work on tooth for scaling, wiring etc from which they get practical exposure.
        
        Moreover universities have huge libraries carrying thousands of books of different subjects and other study material like fictional, non-fictional, journals, newspapers, reports which are huge sources of information for the students and teachers.
        
        Various recreational activities are conducted in universities. Sports meet, youth festivals, Conferences, Seminars, Debates, Declamation contests etc which also helps in getting new experiences.
        
        As a whole while studying in college or universities students build confidence as a trait in themselves which is very essential to be successful in life. So I think people attend college to get exposure, experience, confidence, increased knowledge, career preparation as a whole.
        
        
        Topic 2 Are parents best teachers?
        
        I do strongly agree the idea that parents are the best teachers. This I agree for following reasons.
        
        The first teachers we have in our lives in most cases are our parents. They teach us to walk, to speak, and to have good manners before we reach he real world. ?More than even the professional teachers that we have in school, parents are generally the most involved in the development and education of children.
        
        Almost for sure our parents are the best teachers at the beginning of our lives, which actually corresponds to the parents’ role in nature. Parents are most committed and involved in teaching their children; they have a kind of instinct to sacrifice a part of themselves for the betterment of their children. They love us and have great patience while passing down their knowledge to us. They wish us a success and thus will not teach us bad things. And of course, implicit learning occurs when children unconsciously copy some of their parents’ habits and styles of behavior.

        <p><b>Obviously, the earliest teachers we have in our lives in most cases are our parents, and they are generally the most involved in the development and education of their children. Yet neither are all parents good teachers nor are those good parents the best teachers. First of all, not all parents are good teachers. As normal individuals, some parents more or less have bad habits. Even though parents almost instinctively devote themselves to cultivating their offspring, the outcome might turn out to be disappointment, for all children tend to unconsciously or subconsciously copy every thing from their parents. Another deficiency of parents as teachers is the fact that most parents are lack of common senses of education. All too often we observe some parents tend to pursue their cherished but failed dream by forcing their children to develop in a prearranged direction. Ironically, if their children did not follow the instructions, the children would be regarded as disobedient or allegedly rebellious. In fact, it is parents rather than their children that virtually disobey common senses. Moreover, some parents are qualified as good teachers, but not all of them are the best ones. When children are in the preliminary school, it is not surprising that parents are capable of teaching their children almost every subject even better than professional teachers in the school. But the situation will not last long. We live in a world where knowledge is accumulated by multiplying and at the same time becomes more and more specialized. Therefore, to be a professional in a certain field today takes much longer time than ever before. No parent is able to be professional in all fields, though they might be experts in one or more fields. Wise parents often release rather than charge their children as early as possible. They are aware of the possibility outside the family. Parents may, nevertheless, help their children much more than do good teachers. Most parts of children education are virtually beyond teachers' reaches. It is parents that supplement. Psychology studies have shown us that parents' love sometimes has astonishingly magic power to their children. Albert Einstein's mother and
